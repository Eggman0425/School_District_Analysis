# School District Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the School District Analysis is to take another look at the reading and math scores for Thomas High School, as there was evidence of academic dishonesty that affected the original analysis.
## Results
* The school district summary is affected dramatically in the overall passing rate percentage. The original passing rate was 95% but then dropped to 65% in the new analysis.
* The school summary was affected by drops in overall passing rate percentage from high 90s and 100% in the original analysis, down to low 90s in the top percentages for the new analysis.
* By replacing Thomas High School’s ninth graders’ reading and math scores, their performance wasn’t really affected in comparison to other schools. They still managed a 91% overall passing rate and be in the top five performing schools.
